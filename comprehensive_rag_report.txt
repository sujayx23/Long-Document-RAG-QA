Level 1: Single Chunk Information:
Success Rate: 3/3 (100.0%)

Q: What BPC did Longformer achieve on text8 dataset?
A: BPC of 1.10 on text8 and enwik8 respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.
Success: True

Q: How many tokens can Longformer process compared to BERT's 512 limit?
A: 4,096) 10.299 8.738 + copy position embeddings 1.957 1.597 + 2 K gradient updates 1.753 1.414 + 65 K gradient update 1.705 1.358 Longformer (train extra pos. - In addition, when configured as in RoBERTa-base (seqlen: 512, and n 2 attention) Longformera-base, confirming that per- formance gains are not due to additional pretrain- ing.
Success: True

Q: What window size does Longformer use for local attention?
A: 2 d Linear Projections for Global attention recall that given the linear projections Q, K, V, the transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) attention (QK, V ) = softmax QK T  d k V (1) We use two sets of projections, Q S, K S, V S to compute attention scores of sliding window attention, and Q G, K G, V G to compute Attention scores for the global attention.
Success: True

Level 2: Adjacent Chunks Information:
Success Rate: 3/3 (100.0%)

Q: How does Longformer's memory usage compare to full self-attention as sequence length increases?
A: Unlike the full self-attention, our proposed attention pattern scales linearly with the input sequence, making it efficient for longer sequences.
Success: True

Q: What are the key differences between sliding window and dilated sliding window attention?
A: For Longformer, the dilated sliding window attention computes only a fixed number of the diagonals of QK T. As shown in Fig.
Success: True

Q: How does Longformer initialize position embeddings beyond RoBERTa's 512 limit?
A: by repeatedly copying BART's 1 K position embeddings 16 times as in Section 5 for RoBERTa
Success: True

Level 3: Distant Chunks Information:
Success Rate: 3/3 (100.0%)

Q: How do the character-level language modeling results relate to the downstream task performance improvements?
A: Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8.
Success: True

Q: What is the relationship between Longformer's attention pattern design and its computational efficiency gains?
A: This section discusses the design and implementation of this attention pattern. org Equal contribution Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence Seattle WA USA Longformer: the long-Document transformer 8873 B 564 FAD 1 C 94 E 502 B 48 C 1 C 4 ED 4048 GROBID - A machine learning software for extracting information from scholarly documents transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length.
Success: True

Q: How does the staged training procedure for character LM connect to the pretraining approach for downstream tasks?
A: To accommodate this, we adopt a staged training procedure where we increase the attention window size and sequence length across multiple training phases.
Success: True

Level 4: Cross-Section Analysis:
Success Rate: 3/3 (100.0%)

Q: What evidence supports that both local and global attention components are essential for Longformer's performance?
A: through ablations and controlled trials we show both attention types are essential -the local attention is primarily used to build contextual representations, while the global attention allows Longformer to build full sequence representations for prediction
Success: True

Q: How do the ablation study results validate the architectural choices made in Longformer's design?
A: When pretrained, Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-of-the-art results on Wik-i Hop and Trivia QA.
Success: True

Q: What are the computational trade-offs between different Longformer implementations (loop vs chunks vs CUDA)?
A: Longformer employs an attention pattern that combines local and global information while also scaling linearly with the sequence length. However, they primarily focus on autoregressive language modeling (LM), while the application of long document transformers to documentlevel NLP tasks in the transfer learning setting
Success: True

Level 5: Document-Wide Reasoning:
Success Rate: 3/3 (100.0%)

Q: Based on the experimental setup and results, what are the potential limitations of Longformer for real-time applications?
A: When pretrained, Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-of-the-art results on Wiki-Hop and Trivia QA. transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length.
Success: True

Q: How might the evaluation methodology bias the conclusions about Longformer's effectiveness compared to other approaches?
A: We achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8 benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of Longformer in long document modeling.
Success: True

Q: What aspects of long document understanding are NOT adequately addressed by Longformer's approach?
A: To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer.
Success: True
