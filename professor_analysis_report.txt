RAG SYSTEM FAILURE ANALYSIS - DEEP INVESTIGATION RESULTS

PROFESSOR'S QUESTION: "Why does the RAG system fail on certain question types?"

KEY DISCOVERY:
The system exhibits SYSTEMATIC RETRIEVAL FAILURE, not answer generation issues.

EVIDENCE:
- Tested 5 failed questions across taxonomy levels 1-3
- System retrieves identical chunks for different questions:
  * Chunk 1: Title/metadata (irrelevant)
  * Chunk 2: Generic "Longformer replaces RoBERTa" text
  * Chunk 3: LED description (irrelevant)
- 100% failure rate across all levels (0/5 questions answered correctly)

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
The semantic similarity and keyword matching algorithms are broken:
1. No question-specific chunk retrieval
2. Same irrelevant chunks returned regardless of query content
3. Specific technical chunks (e.g., Chunk 8 with "window size 512") never retrieved

DEEPER INSIGHT:
This is NOT a "chunk distance" problem as initially assumed.
The retrieval algorithm fundamentally fails to match questions to relevant content.

HYPOTHESIS FOR FIXING:
1. Debug embedding model compatibility (dimension mismatch errors seen)
2. Fix keyword extraction logic 
3. Improve chunk preprocessing quality
4. Test alternative semantic similarity approaches

CONCLUSION:
The taxonomy levels are irrelevant - the system fails because it cannot retrieve appropriate chunks for any question type. The problem is algorithmic, not architectural.
